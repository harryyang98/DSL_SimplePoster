At this point, we divided all the work equally in our group. We have started tokenizing and parsing. We finished the parts of code about tokenizing the program, postPanel, postText and parsing them. We have just started evaluate and UI.

For the final user study, even though this year is different due to COVID-19 and isolation, but we are still planning to get some volunteers to try out our final version language. Since our target users are both professional and unprofessional programmer, we are planning to get two kinds of volunteers, one with experiencing in programming and the other has no background in programming. We will collect the feedback, and then discuss if thereâ€™s anything we should change for the final version. 

This project is due Oct.19th. We are planning to finish the coding part before the 15th and finish the user study before 17th. In this case, we will have more people doing UI and evaluate. We will wrap up tokenizing and parsing shortly.
