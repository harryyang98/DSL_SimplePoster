First user study:
In this user study, we had 2 volunteers, one has coding experience and the other one has no coding background. 
We explained our idea and basic grammar to the volunteers. We asked them to try some basic features including adding a text.(beta version)

Then we asked volunteers to give us feedback. We got: 
1.Every attribute has a strict policy on position, meaning that each attribute should only occur at a certain position. Our volunteers do not like this.
2.Our volunteers like the idea we have all fixed literals capitalized. They think this makes the language easier to learn. 
3.They like the idea that they can generate the poster at any time. So they can visualize what has changed and what should be done next to the poster.
4.They donâ€™t like that there are too many fixed literals in this language. They need to memorize all the fixed literals, so they can code.
