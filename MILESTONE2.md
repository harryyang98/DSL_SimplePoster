# Milestone 2:

## Schedule Of DSL Project


| Date          | Task                                          | Note                                                  |
| :---------:    |:---------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------:|
| Sept.28 2020  | Finish  a complete grammar usage for our DSL  | Will have a meeting during weekend about the grammar  |
| Oct. 5   2020  | Trying to have a general concept on parsing, collect plans under unusual situation  |Will have a brainstorm on what kind of error could happen in userâ€™s input   |
|Oct 12, 2020   | Expected functionalities are delivered.  |  Users can apply 3 dynamic features and the poster generates. |
|Oct. 16        |Get volunteers, share our idea and simple version of DSL and get feedback|Get feedback then discuss what to improve next|
|Oct. 19 | Create an UI interface for users to easily see the poster after generated. The UI should be 2 parts. One part is for users to write code, the other part is showing the poster created by the code.| Should get volunteers to try the DSL after the ui is created. We should ask some volunteers from evaluation to do this part again, in case to check how big the improvement we made. Also we should get new volunteers to avoid bias.|




















Tasks Responsibility (May change in the future):
* Finalizing DSL grammar. (all members)
* Tokenization: this task is to tokenize the user-input into a tokenized form, like what we discussed in lectures. The token format is not subjected on what we have seen; can be/ will be changed to something suitable for our DSL. (Harry, Winter)*
* Parsing: parse the tokens into some sorts of formats for evaluation. (Jie)
* Evaluation: evaluate the parsed information and get it run. (Mufeng)
* UI of the program: this task is to implement the ui for our project; it allows the user to easily interact with our program, simply entering the DSL code, running it on the user interface and seeing the results immediately. (JingBo)


What we have done so far:
* We have written a complete user-case, that the code includes all possible usage of our DSL. This would simplify work of the group member who is responsible for tokenization, and give him a clear picture of what to expect.
* Did some grammar writing for the very simple cases; will make the complete one  during our discussion in the weekend.
